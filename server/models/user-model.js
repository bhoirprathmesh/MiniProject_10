// **What is JWT?** 
// - JSON Web Tokens (JWT) is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. 
//? - JWTs are often used for authentication and authorization in web applications. 
//? 1. **Authentication:** Verifying the identity of a user or client. 
//? 2. **Authorization:** Determining what actions a user or client is allowed to perform. 

// Link : https://jwt.io/

// **Components of a JWT:** 
// - Header: Contains metadata about the token, such as the type of token and the sigeing algorithm being used. 
// - Payload: Contains clains or statements about an entity (typically, the user) and additional data. Common clains inclute user 10, username, and expiration time.
// - Signature: To verify that the sender of the JWT is who it says it is and to ensure that the message wasn't changed along the way, a signature is included.

// json web taken : 
// Tokens, such as JWTs (JSON Web Tokens), are typically not stored in the database along with other user details. 
// Instead, they are issued by the server during the authentication process and then stored on the client-side (e.g., in cookies or local storage) for later use.
